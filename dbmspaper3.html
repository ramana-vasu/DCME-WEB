    </div>
    
    <h1></h1>
    <h2>(DBMS)</h2>
    <p>DBMS (Database Management System) : Database Management System is basically software that manages the collection of related data. It is used for storing data and
retrieving the data effectively when it is needed. It also provides proper securitymeasures for protecting the data from unauthorized access. In Database Management
System the data can be fetched by SQL queries and relational algebra. It also providesmechanisms for data recovery and data backup.
Example : Oracle, MySQL, MS SQL server.</p>
<h2>MOSTLY REPEATED QUESTIONS IN PREVIOUS EXAMINATIONS:</h2>
<p><br>1) define the terms super key,candidate key and primary key.</br>
   <br>  2) compare RDBMS & NOSQL..</br>

<br>3) define the terms instance and schema</br>

<br>4) what is NOSQL ?list the advantages of NOSQL.</br>

<br>5) list any three schema objects.</br>

<br>6) how to drop a database in mongodb.</br>

<br>7) list the features of pl/sql.</br>

<br>9) explain different looping statements with examples.</br>
 
<br>10)explain in details about various integrity constants. </br>

<br>11)explain joins with examples.</br></p>
<h2><u>ANSWERS FOR REPEATED QUESTIONS</u></h2>
<p><br>1)Super Key</br>
A superkey is a group of single or multiple keys which identifies rows in a table.A Super key may have additional 
attributes that are not needed for unique identification.

<br>Candidate key</br>
It is a set of attributes that uniquely identify tuples in a table. Candidate Key is a super key with no repeated attributes.
The Primary key should be selected from the candidate keys. Every table must have at least a single candidate key. 
A table can have multiple candidate keys but only a single primary key. 

<br>primary key</br>
It is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identify every row in that table. 
The Primary Key can't be a duplicate meaning the same value can't appear more than once in the table. A table cannot have more than one primary key
The primary key field cannot be null.The value in a primary key column can never be modified or updated if any foreign key refers to that primary key

<br>2)<u>RDBMS</u>
<br>.users know RDBMS well as it is old and many organizations use this database for the proper format of data.</br>
<br>.user interface tools to access data is available is the market so that users can try with all the schema to the RDBMS infrastructure.this helps
to interact with the data well and users will understand the data in a better manner.</br>
<br>.RDBMS scalability and performance faces some issues if the data is huge.servers may not run properly with the available load and this 
leads to performance issues.</br>
<br>.multiple tables can be joined easily in RDBMS and this does not cause any latency in the working of the database.the primary key helps in this case.</br>
<br>.data analysis and querying can be dine easily ⁬with RDBMS even though the queries are complex.
slicing and dicing can be done with the available data to make the proper analysis of the data given.</br>
<br>.document cannot be stored in RDBMS because data in the database should be structured and in a proper format to create identifiers.</br>
<br>.partitions cannot be created in the database.key value pairs are needed to identify the data in a particular format specified in the schema database.</br>
<br>2)<u>NoSQL</u>
<br>.this is relatively new and experts in NoSQL are less as this database is evolving day by day.</br>
<br>.user interface tools to access and manipulate data in NoSQL is very less and hence users do not have many options to interact with data.</br>
<br>.it works well with high loads.scalability is very good in NoSQL.this makes the performance of the database better when compared with RDBMS.
A huge amount of data could be easily handled by users.</br>
<br>.multiple tables cannot be joined in NoSQL as it is not an easy task for the database and does not work well with the performance of the data.</br>
<br>.data analysis is done also in the NoSQL but it works well with real-time data analytics.reports are not done in the database but if hte appilication has
 to be built,then Nosql is a solutions for the same.</br>
<br>.document can be stored in the NoSQL database as this is unstructured and not in rows and columns format.</br>
<br>.partitions can be stored in the NoSQL database easily and key-value pairs are not needed to to identify the data in the source. 
software as a service can be integrated with NoSQL.</br>
<br>3)Instances: Instances are the collection of information stored at a particular moment. The instances can be changed by certain CRUD operations
 as like addition, deletion of data.It may be noted that any search query will not make any kind of changes in the instances. </br>
<br>Example: Lets say a table teacher in our database whose name is School, suppose the table has 50 records so,the instance of the database has 50 records for now and tomorrow 
we are going to add another fifty records so tomorrow the instance have total 100 records. This is called an instance.</br>
<br>Schemas: Schema is the overall description of the database. The basic structure of how the data will be stored in the database is called schema.
Schema is of two types. They are :</br>

<br>(i) Logical Schema : It describes the database designed at logical level.</br>

<br>(ii) Physical Schema : It describes the database designed at physical level.</br>
<br> Example: Lets say a table teacher in our database name school, 
the teacher table require the name, dob, doj in their table so we design a structure as :</br>
<br>Teacher table</br>
<br>name: String</br>
<br>doj: date all inT: (love. I learnt)</br>
<br>dob: date m</br>
<br>Above given is the schema of the table teacher.</br>
<br>4) NOSQL: NoSQL database stands for "Not Only SQL" or "Not SQL." Though a better term would be "NOREL", NoSQL caught on. 
Carl Strozz introduced the NoSQL concept in 1998.Traditional RDBMS uses SQL syntax to store and retrieve data for further insights. 
Instead, a NoSQL database system encompasses a wide range of database technologies that can store structured, semi-structured,
 unstructured and polymorphic data.</br>
<brAdvantages of NoSQL Databases: Regardless of these obstacles, NoSQL databases have been widely adopted in many enterprises for the following reasons:</br>
<br>1 Elastic Scalability: RDBMSs are not as easy to scale out on commodity clusters, whereas NoSQL databases are made for transparent expansion,
 taking advantage of new nodes. These databases are designed for use with low-cost commodity hardware In a world where upward scalability is
 being replaced by outward scalability, NoSQL databases are a better fit.</br>
<br>2. Big Data Applications: Given that transaction rates are growing from recognition, there is need to store massive volumes of data. 
While RDBMSs have grown to match the growing needs, but its difficult to realistically use one RDBMS to manage such data volumes. 
These volumes are however easily handled by NoSQL databases.</br>
<br>3. Database Administration: The best RDBMSs require the services of expensive administrators to design, Install and maintain the systems.
 On the other hand, NoSQL databases require much less hands-on management, with data distribution and auto repair capabilities, simplified data
 models and fewer tuning and administration requirements. However, in practice, someone will always be needed to take care of performance and
 availability of databases.</br>
<br>4. Economy: RDBMSs require installation of expensive storage systems and proprietary servers, while NoSQL databases can be easily installed in 
cheap commodity hardware clusters as transaction and data volumes increase. This means that you can proces and store more data at much less cost.</br>
<br>6) Dropping of Database : MongoDB db.dropDatabase() command is used to drop a existing database.</br>
<br>Steps:</br>
Select the database.
<br>Drop the database.</br>
syntax:
<br> use <database_name></br>
db.dropdatabase()
<br>example</br>
use employee
<br>db.dropdatabase()</br>
<br>this will be delete the selected database.if you have not selected any database,then it will delete default 'test' database</br>
<br>example:first,check the list of variables database by using the command,show dbs.</br>
<br>>show dbs</br>
local 0.78125GB</br>
mydb 0.23012GB</br>
test 0.23012GB</br>>
<br>if  you want to delete new database <mydb>, then drop database() command would be as follow:</break>
<br>>use mydb</br>
switched to db mydb</br>
>db.dropdatabase()</br>
>{"dropped". : "mydb","ok" : 1}</br>>
<br>now check list of databases.</br>
<br>>show dbs</br>
local 0.78125GB</br>
test 0.23012GB</br>>
<br>7)FEATURES OF PL/SQL:</br>
<br>PL/SQL is tightly integrated with SQL.</br>
<br>.it offers extensive error checking.</br>
<br>.it offers numerous data types.</br>
<br>.it offers a variety of programming structures.</br>
<br>.it supports structured programming through functions and procedures.</br>
<br>.it supports object-oriented programming.</br>
<br>.it supports the development of web applications and server pages.</br>
<br>8)1.CREATE DATABASE</br>
<br>we can use below command to create a database on SQL server instance.to create a database,we must be logged into the server and have appropriate permissions
(CREATE DATABASE,CREATE ANY DATABASE,OR ALTER ANY DATABASE).</br>
<br>syntax:CREATE DATABASE<database_name</br>>
<br>2.ALTER DATABASE</br>
<br>we can change the settings of created database using ALTER DATABASE command.for example,to modify the file name (data or log file),</br>
<br>syntax:ALTER DATABASE=database-name</br>
<br>MODIFY FILE(name=old file name</br>
<br>newname=new file name)</br>
<br>3.DROP DATABASE</br>
<br>to delete a database permanently from the server</br>
<br>syntax:DROP DATABASE=database-name</br>
<br>9)looping in PL/SQL provides a way of repeating a particular part of any program or any code statements as many times as required.</br>
<br>in PL/SQL we have three different loop options to choose from when we want to execute a statements repeatedly in our code block .they are:</br>
<br>1.basic loop</br>
<br>2.while loop</br>
<br>3.for loop</br>
<br>in this tutorial we learn about all three of them while coverting the concept of nexted loops which means loop inside a loop.so lets get started.</br>
<br>1.PL/SQL basic loop:basic loop or simple is preffered in PL/SQL code when there is no surety about how many times the block of code is to be repeated.when we use 
the basic loop the code block will be executed at least once.</br>
<br>while using it,following two things must be considered:</br>
<br>Simple loop always begins with the keyword LOOP and ends with a keyword END LOOP.</br>
<br>A basic/simple loop can be terminated at any given point by using the exit statement or by specifying certain condition by using the statement exit</br>
<br>syntax:</br>
<br>LOOP</br>
sequence of statements
<br>END LOOP;</br>
lets see the simple loop in action in the code example below.
<br>time for an example</br>
In the code below ,we have used the loop to print counting from 1 to 10 on the console and have used the exit statement to break out of the loop.
<br> set serveroutput on;</br>
<br>DECLARE</br>
i int;
<br>BEGIN</br>
i:=1;
<br>LOOP</br>
  if i>10 then
        <br> exit;</br>
end if;
<br>dbms_output.put_line(i);</br>
i:=i+1;
<br>END LOOP;</br>
END;
<br>1</br>
<br>2</br>
<br>3</br>
<br>4</br>
<br>5</br>
<br>6</br>
<br>7</br>
<br>8</br>
<br>9</br>
<br>10</br>
PL/SQL procedures sucessfully completed
<br>lets take one more example where we will be using the exit when statements to break out of the loop.</br>
set serveroutput on;
<br>DECLARE</br>
i Int;
<br>BEGIN</br>
i:=0;
<br>LOOP</br>
i:=i+2
<br>dbms_output.put_line(i);</br>
exit WHENx>10
<br>END LOOP;</br>
END;
<br>2</br>
<br>4</br>
<br>6</br>
<br>8</br>
<br>10</br>
PL/SQL procedure sucessfully completed
<br>PL/SQL:while Loop:It is an entry controlled loop which means that before entering in a while loop first the condition is tested,if the condition is TRUE the statements 
or a group of statements get executed and if the condition FALSE the control will move out of the while loop.</br>
syntax:
<br>WHILE<test_condition>LOOP</br>
<br>END LOOP;</br>
lets see the while loop in action in the code examole below.
<br>time for an example!</br>
<br>below we have a simple program to print the odd numbers between 1 to 10 using the while loop.</br>
<br>set serveroutput on;</br>
<br>DECLARE</br>
num int:=1;
<br>BEGIN</br>
while(num<=10)LOOP
<br>dbms_output.put_line("||no);</br>
num:=num+2;
<br>END LOOP;</br>
END;
<br>1</br>
3
<br>5</br>

<br>9</br>
<br>PL/SQL procedure sucessfully completed.</br>
<br>PL/SQL: For Loop: This loop is used when some statements in PL/SQL code block are to be repeated for a fixed number of times.When we use the for loop we are 
supposed to define a counter variable which decides how many time the loop will be executed based on a starting and ending value provided at the beginning of the loop. 
shirley is The for loop automatically increments the value of the counter variable by 1 at the end of each loop cycle.</br>
The programmer need not have to write any instruction for incrementing or decrementing Value.
<br> FOR counter_variable IN start_value..end_value LOOP</br>
statement to be executed
<br>END LOOP;</br>

Let's see the for loop in action in the example below.

Time for an Example!

In the example below we have used a the for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.

set serveroutput on;
<br>DECLARE</br>
i number(2);
<br>for i in 1..10LOOP</br>
dbms_output.put_line(i);
<br>END LOOP;<br>
END;

now. let's take another example where we will print the number in reverse order.
<br>set serveroutput on;</br>
DECLARE
<br>i number(2);</br>
BEGIN 
<br> FOR i IN REVERSE 1..10LOOP</br>
END LOOP;
<br>END;</br>

<br>10)SQL Constraints are rules used to limit the type of data that can go into a table, to maintain the accuracy and integrity of the data inside table.</br>
Constraints can be divided into the following two types. They are:

<br>1. Column Level Constraints: Limits only column data.</br>

2. Table Level Constraints: Limits whole table data.

<br>Constraints are used to make sure that the integrity of data is maintained in the database Following are the most used constraints that can be applied to a table.</br>
.NULL CONSTANTS
<br>.UNIQUE</br>
.PRIMARY KEY
<br>.FOREIGN KEY</br>
.CHECK
<br>.DEFAULT</br>
NOT NULL Constraint: NOT NULL constraint restricts a column from having NULL value. Once NOT NULL constraint is applied to a column, 
you cannot pass null value to that column. It enforces a column to contain a proper value.
<br>UNIQUE Constraint: UNIQUE constraint ensures that a field or column will onl have unique values. A UNIQUE constraint field will not have duplicate data.
 The AMPLE-2 constraint can be applied at column level or table level.</br>
Primary Key Constraint: Primary key constraint uniquely identifies each record in database. A Primary Key must contain unique value and it must not contain nu value.
 Usually Primary Key is used to index the data inside the table.
<br>Foreign Key Constraint: FOREIGN KEY is used to relate two tables. FOREIGN KEY constraint is also used to restrict actions that would destroy links between tables.
understand FOREIGN KEY, let's see its use, with help of the below tables</br>
<br>CHECK Constraint: CHECK constraint is used to restrict the value of a colum between a range. It performs check on the values, before storing them into the database. 
It's like condition checking before saving data into a column.</br>
SQL Constraints: SQL constraints are used to specifly rules for the data in a table Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. 
This ensures th accuracy and reliability of the date in the table.

<br>⚫ Constraints can be column level or table level. The following constraints are common used in SQL.</br>
.NOT NULL
<br> UNIQUE</br>
PRIMARY KEY
<br>FOREIGN KEY</br>
CHECK
<br>DEFAULT</br>
SQL NOT NULL : By default, a column can hold null values. The NOTNULL constraint enforces a column to not accept null values. This enforces a field to always Contain a value
<br>CREATE TABLE Hero</br>
<br>ID              int                       NOT NULL,</br>
<br>Iname       varchar(30)       NOT NULL,</br>
<br>Iname       varchar(30)       NOT NULL,</br>
age         int),
<br>SQL Unique Constraint: It ensures that all values in a column are different. Both unique and primary key constraints provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a 
column or set of columns. However you can have many unique constraints for table.</br>
Oracle:
<br> CREATE  TABLE  Hero(</br>
ID int NOT NULL UNIQUE,
<br>Iname VARCHAR(30)NOT NULL,</br>
<br>Iname VARCHAR(30)NOT NULL,</br>
age int);
<br>MySQL:</br>
.CREATE TABLE Hero(
<br>ID int NOT NULL,</br>
Iname varchar(30) NOT NULL,
<br>Iname varchar(30) NOT NULL,
age  int,
<br>UNIQUE(ID);</br>
defining a unique constraint on multiple columns;
<br>10)• SQL Joins: A SQL join statement is used to combine data or rows from two or more tables based on a common field between them. vasa
Different types of Joins are :</br>
<br> Different types of Joins are :</br>

1. Equi Join,

<br>2. Non-Equi Joins,</br>

• Inner Join, and3 Cross join, and

<br>4. Self join</br>

Consider the Two Tables Below:

<br>CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE(EMP_ID integer, EMP_NAME varchar(20), CITY varchar(20), SALARY bigint, AGE Integer);</br>
CREATE TABLE PROJECT(PROJECT_NO integer, EMP_ID integer, DEPARTMENT
<br>varchar(20)),</br>
insert into EMPLOYEE values(1,'Angelina','Chicago',200000,30);
<br>insert into EMPLOYEE values(2, 'Robert', 'Austin',300000,26);</br>
Insert into EMPLOYEE values(3,'Christian', 'Denver', 100000,42);
<br>insert into EMPLOYEE values(4, 'Kristen', 'Washington',500000,29);</br>
Insert into EMPLOYEE values(5,'Russell', 'Los angels',200000,36);
<br>insert into EMPLOYEE values(6, Marry', 'Canada',600000,48);</br>
Insert into PROJECT values(101,1, Testing");
<br>insert into PROJECT values(102,2,'Development');</br>
insert into PROJECT values(103,3,'Designing');
<br>insert into PROJECT values(104,4,'Development');</br>
