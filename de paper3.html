<br>2)10011+10100=101000</br>
<br>11100+01011=100011</br>
<br>5)The NAND gate has two or more input signals but only one output signal. All Input signals must be high to get a low output.
 Fig. 2.40<br> (a) shows the logical structure of a NAND gate, an AND gate followed by an inventer. Therefore the final output is NOT
 the AND of the inputs. Originally called a NOT-AND gate, the circuit is now referred to as a NAND gate. </br>Fig. 2.40 <br>(b) is the 
symbol for a NAND gate.</br> The inverter triangle has been deleted and the bubble moved to the AND gate output. If one or more 
inputs are low the result of ANDing is low; therefore the final inverted output is high. Only when all inputs are high does the 
ANDing produce a high signal; then the final output is low.</br>
Table 2.23 summarizes the action of a 2 input NAND gate The boolean expression for a 2 Input NAND gate is
<br>Using the De-Morgans theorem we have AB = A+B. Therefore the NAND gate can also be got by giving the inputs to
 two different Inverters and connecting the output of the Inverters to a two input OR gate as shown in Fig. 2.40 (c). 
The circuit symbd of such a connection is given in Fig. 2.40 (d).</br>
Regardless of how many inputs a NAND gate has, it is still logically equivalent to an AND gate followed by a NOT gate. 
The expression for 3 input NAND gate is Y=ABC
<br>The NOR gate has two or more input signals but only one output signal. All inputs must be low to get a high output.
 In other words, the NOR gate recognizes only the input word whose bits are all O's. Fig. 2.41<br> (a) shows a logical structure of a 
NOR gate, which is an OR gate followed by an Inverter. Therefore the final output is NOT the OR of the Inputs. Originally called
 a NOT-OR gate, the circuit in now referred to as a NOR gate.</br> Fig. 2.41 (b) is a symbol for NOR gata. Notice that the inverter
 triangle has been deleted and the small bubble moved to the OR gate output.</br>
<br>6)From truth table, it can be seen that the output a logic I when only one of the inputs is at logic 1. When both the inputs are lor 0 
then the output is logic 0. Thus the output is 1 only when there are odd number of logic 1s at the input. The logic expression for 
the exclusive OR gate can be obtained from the truth table and it is</br>
<br>Y = The symbol used for the EX-OR operation Is . Therefore the expression can be written as Y = AOB. Fig. 2.39 gives the 3 
Input EX-OR gate and table 2.22 gives its truth table.</br>
<br>The JK Sp-hop is refinement of the RS flip-flop. The indeterminate state (R-S-1) of RS flip-flop is determined in JK flip-flop 
In this condition (J K. 1), the complement of previous output is results as present output known as toggle. For this

<br>Pg 3.12 shows a JK fip-Bop. When J and K low, for leading edge of CLK both the input gates are disabled and the circuit is

<br>When J is high and K is low, the lower gate is disabled means S 1. So there is no way to reset the flip-flop. The only possibility
 is set. When Q is low, Q is high: therefor, the upper gate passes a trigger on the positive clock edge. This drives Q in to the high
 state. That is, J. 1 and K 0 means that the next positive clock edge sets the flip-flop.</br>
<br>8)Frequency counters
Digital clocks
Analog to digital convertors.</br>
<br>With some changes in their design, counters can be used as frequency divider circuits. The frequency divider circuit is that 
which divides the input frequency exactly by ‘2’.
In time measurement. That means calculating time in timers such as electronic devices like ovens and washing machines.
We can design digital triangular wave generator by using counters.</br>
There are many other type of counters rather than synchronous and asynchronous counters, such as Decade counter, Binary
 counter, Ring counter, Johnson counter, Up / Down counter etc. , which we will discuss about them in our upcoming sessions.</br>
<br>When the CLK is high, R and S are high, the R' and S' both becomes low. Which gives forbidden condition. This is know
 race condition for SR flip-flop Fig 3 10 shows the timing diagram of S R flip-flop. Q goes high when S is high and CLK goes high 
Q returns to low state when R is high and CLK goes high. R and S inputs never be high for high CLK.</br>
<br>Table 3.3 summarizes the operation of the clocked RS flip-flop. When CLK is low, the output is latched in its previous state. 
When the CLK is high, the circuit will set if S is high or reset if R is high. CLK, R and S all high is a race condition</br>
