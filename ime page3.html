    <h2>INTRODUCTION TO IME:</h2> <br>
    <p>Management plays an important role in every organization. Management is a universal and dynamic process of all economic and non-economic activities in an organization. It is not merely restricted to a factory (or) office. It is necessary for business firms, government organisations, education, health services and many other organisations.

        'Management' is the process of planning, organizing, staffing, leading, directing, and controlling the activities of an organization. To achieve the goals of an organization, it is necessary to guide, direct and co-ordinate the efforts of others. Thus, management is the art of getting things done through people to accomplish desired goals and objectives using available resources efficiently and effectively. Therefore, it can be said that no organisation can enjoy a successful existence and survival without competent management.
        
        Whereas, Industrial Management' is concerned with the organizational process, which includes policies and procedures, strategic planning, setting objectives, managing the resources such as human and financial resources needed to achieve the objectives, and finally measuring the results. It integrates manpower, materials, and other factors in productive ways and utilizes all the available resources to the maximum extent.</p> <br>

<br>
These are as follows:
<br>
1. Departmental Undertakings: Departmental undertakings are the oldest among public enterprises. A departmental undertaking is organized, managed and financed by the government.

The Registrar will depute his officials to visit the first general body meeting, where bye-laws are formed, and the directors are elected at the meeting.
