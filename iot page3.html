    <h2>Introduction to IOT:</h2> 
    <p>Internet of Things (IoT) is the networking of physical objects that contain electronics embedded within their architecture in order to communicate and sense interactions amongst each other or with respect to the external environment. In the upcoming years, IoT-based technology will offer advanced levels of services and practically change the way people lead their daily lives. Advancements in medicine, power, gene therapies, agriculture, smart cities, and smart homes are just a very few of the categorical examples where loT is strongly established.</p>

         <h2>ANSWERS FOR THE QUESTIONS:</h2>
           <br>
<h4>working principle of NFC:</h4>
   <br>

NFC operate on the principle of inductive coupling, at least for short-range implementations. This essentially involves the reader device generating a magnetic field by passing an electric current through a coil. When a tag (with its own coil) is brought nearby, the field induces an electric current within the tag - sans any wires or even physical contact. Then, once the initial handshake is complete, any stored data on the

tag is wirelessly transmitted to the reader.
<br>
NFC, however, only has a maximum range of a few centimeters, at most. And in most smartphone-related applications, you'll find that the software will only initiate communication if there's physical contact. This is to prevent accidental triggers- especially important now that the technology is used for transferring sensitive data.
           <br>
           <h4>MQTT:</h4>
            <br>
            <p>MQTT stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport. It is a lightweight messaging protocol for use in cases where clients need a small code footprint and are connected to unreliable networks or networks with limited bandwidth resources. It is primarily used for Internet of Thing (IoT) or machine-to-machine (M2M) communication types of connection
                <br>
                MQTT Architecture:
The devices which are connected to 'MQTT' protocol is known as 'clients.
<br>
Clients communicate with a server is known as 'broker'.
<br>
• These broker handles the task of data transmission between clients.
<br>
• Whenever a client known as the "publisher" wants to distribute information, it will publish to a particular topic,
<br>
The broker then sends this information to any clients that have subscribed to that topic known as "subscribers",
<br>
The publisher does not need any data on the number or the locations of subscribers
<br>
⚫ subscribers do not need any data about the publisher.

Any client can be a publisher, subscriber, or both.
<br>
• The clients are typically not aware of each other, only of the broker that serves as

the intermediary.
<br>
This setup is popularly known as the "pub/sub model.".
<br>
<h4>NFC:</h4>
<br>
<p>NFC (near field communication) is the technology that allows two devices-like your

    phone and a payments terminal to talk to each other when they're close together. NFC is the technology that enables contactless payments:
    <br>
    Types and Applications of NFC:
    <br>
    
    There are two main types of NFC devices:
    <br>
    1. Passive communication NFC devices and
    <br>
    2. Active communication NFC devices
    <br>

    1. Passive NFC: on the other hand, can only send data. However, passive NFC provides an extra benefit. The passive devices can run without power. You can find passive NFC on all sorts of devices that need to communicate with others. For example, our student ID cards use NFC technology. If you tap your card on the bus, your card is passively transferring information through NFC to the bus system's active card reader, which allows the bus system to realize that you are a Carnegie Mellon student and charge the university for your trip. Billboards and signs can also use NFC. You can usually tap one of these with a phone to get more information about the topic discussed on the board.
    <br>
    2. Active NFC: which is currently used on many Android devices, as well as the new Apple devices, can send and receive data. One major use of NFC is storing and transferring contact or credit card information. With apps such as Google Wallet on Android phones, you can simply tap your device to pay at stores.
    
    Applications of Near Field Communication
    <br>
    • Smart Cards
    <br>
    E-wallet (payment using smart phone)
    <br>
    • Smart Ticketing
    <br>
    • Medicine and Healthcare
    <br>
    • Keyless Access
    <br>
    Manufacturing Logistics and Shipping
    
    Smart Inventory Management
<br>
<h4>Features of IEEE 802.15.4 </h4> 
<br>
<p>
    Joining and leaving the PAN;
    <br>
    • Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA-CA) for channel access.
    
    Guaranteed Time Slot (GTS) transmissions.
    <br>
    Establishing a reliable link between two peer MAC entities.
    <br>
    • Beacon transmissions for a coordinator.
    
    Synchronization to the beacons.
    </p>
<h4>AMQP:</h4>
<br>
<p>
    The publishers produce the messages, the consumers pick them up and process them.
    <br>
    It's the job of the message broker (such as RabbitMQ) to ensure that the messages
    <br>
    from a publisher go to the right consumers.
    <br>
    In order to do that, the broker uses two key components:
    <br>
    1. Exchanges
    <br>
    2. Queues
    <br>
    A publisher sends messages to a named exchange and a consumer pulls messages from a queue or the queue pushes them to the consumer depending on the configuration.
<br>
The connections have to be made in the first place, so the question is how do publishers and consumers discover each other? Answer is Via the name of the exchange. Usually, either the publisher or consumer creates the exchange with a given name and then makes that name public.
<br>
</p>
<h4>ZIGBEE topologies:</h4>
<br>
<p>The Zigbee Network Layer in the Zigbee Stack is responsible for formation of the network. There are three Zigbee Network Topologies: Star, Cluster Tree and Mesh. These three Zigbee Topologies come under one of the two network topologies mentioned in the IEEE 802.15.4 i.e., Star and Peer-to-Peer.
<br>
    1. Star Topology: In a Star Network Configuration, there is one Coordinator and any number of End Devices. All the End Devices are connected to the Coordinator and the individual End Devices are isolated, both physically and electrically i.e., no direct communication between end devices.
<br>
2. Cluster Tree Topology: The Cluster Tree Topology is a type of Peer-to-Peer Topology. In Zigbee Cluster Tree Topology, the End Devices join the network via the Coordinator or the Router. As the Zigbee Router extends the range of the Zigbee Network, the End Device need not be in the range of the coordinator <br>
<br>
Even in Tree Topology, the End Devices cannot communicate with each other directly, but the Router can communicate with other Routers and the Coordinator.
<br>
3. Mesh Topology: The Zigbee Mesh Topology is also a Peer-to-Peer Topology and is an extension to the Cluster Tree Topology. The End Devices that are configured as FFD can directly communicate with other FFD Devices (either Routers or End Devices). But End Devices configured as RFD, still need to communicate through Routers or coordinators.
<br>
</p>
<h4>CoAP Message Model:</h4>
<br>
    COAP Message is lowest layer and deals with UDP exchanging messages between endpoints. CoAP message has unique ID and three parts:
    <br>
    ---->A binary header
    <br>
    ---->A compact option
    <br>
    ---->Payload
    <br>
    CoAP protocol uses two kinds of messages:
    <br>
    1. Confirmable message
    <br>
    2. Non-confirmable message
    <br>
    • A COAP confirmable message is a reliable message.
    <br>
    • During exchanging messages between two endpoints, these messages can be reliable.
    <br>
    In the CoAP protocol, a reliable message is obtained using a Confirmable message (CON). Using this kind of message, the client can be sure that the message will arrive at the server.
<br>
⚫A COAP Confirmable message is sent again and again until the other party sends an acknowledge message (ACK).
<br>
The ACK message contains the same ID of the confirmable message (CON). In the above diagram, you can see communication but If the server has troubles managing the incoming request it can send back a Rest message (RST) instead of the Acknowledge message (ACK).
<br>
Non-confirmable (NON) Messages:
<br>
This don't require an Acknowledge by the server.
<br>
• These messages are unreliable messages means do not contain critical information that must be delivered to the server.
<br>
To this category belongs messages that contain values read from sensors. • Even if these messages are unreliable, they have a unique ID.
