    <h2> INTRODUCTION TO JAVA</h2>
    <p>Java a high-level, general-purpose, object-oriented, and secure programming language

        developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, Inc. in 1991. It is formally known as OAK In 1995, Sun Microsystem changed the name to Java.
        
        In 2009, Sun Microsystem takeover by Oracle Corporation.
        <br>
        Editions of Java 2
        <br>
        Each edition of Java has different capabilities
        <br>
        There are three editions of Java
        <br>
        1. Java Standard Editions (JSE): It is used to create programs for a desktop computer
        <br>
        2. Java Enterprise Edition (JEE): It is used to create large programs that run on the server and manages heavy traffic and complex transactions.
        <br>
        3.Java Micro Edition (JME): It is used to develop applications for small devices
        
        wich as set-top boxes, phone, and appliances.
         <br>
         Java Platform:
<br>
• Java Platform is a collection of programs.
<br>
⚫ It helps to develop and run a program written in the Java programming language • Java Platform includes an execution engine, a compiler and set of libraries.
<br>
• Java is a platform-independent language. <br> </p>

<h2>ANSWERS FOR REPEATED QUESTIONS</h2>
  <br>
    <h4>interface:</h4> <br>
    <p>1.

        The interface keyword is used to declare interface.
        <br>
       2. Interface support multiple inheritance.
        
<br>
        
    
        
        3.Interface doesn't contain Data Member. Interface doesn't contain Constructors.
        <br>
        4.An interface Contains only incomplete member (signature of member) and Interface can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8 it can have default and static methods also.
         <br>
        5.
        
        An interface cannot have access modifiers by default everything is assumed as public.
        <br>
        6.
        
        Member of interface cannot be static.
        <br>
        7.
        
        Interface has only static and final variables.  <br>
        9.

Interface are implicitly abstract and cannot have implementations.
  <br>
10.

Interface should be implemented using keyword "implements". An interface can extend another Java interface

only.
<br>
11.

Example:
<br>
public interface IntfaceName{
<br>
void draw(); <br>
    </p>
    <h4>abstract class:</h4>
       <br>
       <p>1.The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class.
<br>
       2. Abstract class does not support multiple inheritance.
        <br>
       3. Abstract class contains Data Member.
        <br>
      4.  Abstract class contains Constructors.
        <br>
       5. An abstract class Contains both incomplete (abstract) and complete members and Abstract 8 class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
        <br>
       6. An abstract class can contain access modifiers for the methods, properties.
        <br>
       7. Only Complete Member of abstract class can be static.
        <br>
       8. Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.
      <br>
     9. A abstract class can have instance methods tha implements a default behavior.
<br>
     10. A Java abstract class should be extended using keyword "extends".
      <br>
     11. An abstract class can extend another Java class
      
      and implement multiple Java interfaces.
      <br>
      Example:
      <br>
      public abstract classClsName
      <br>
      {
        <br> public abstract void method();
     <br>
    </p>
    <h4>package:</h4>
    <br>
    <p>A PACKAGE:
        <br>
        
        1. Deline Package:
        <br>
        • A Java package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages
        <br>
    -->Package in Java can be categorized in two form, built-in package and user
        
        defined package
        <br>
        There are many built-in packages such as java, lang, awt, javax, swing, net, lo util, sql etc..
        <br>
        • Here, we will have the detailed learning of creating and using user-defined packages 2 Advantage of Java Package:
        <br>
        • Java package is used to categorize the classes and interfaces so that they can be easily maintained.
        <br>
        Java package provides access protection.
        <br>
        Java package removes naming collision. Example for create a package in java by using package keyword:
        <br>
        save as Simple.java
        <br>
        package mypack:
        <br>
        public class Simple
        <br>
        {  <br>

        
        public static void main(String args[])
        <br>
        {
            <br>
        System.out.println("Welcome to package");
        <br>
        }
        <br>
        }
        
        How to compile Java Package: If you are not using any IDE, you need to follow the syntax given below:
        <br>
        ⚫ javac -d directory javafilename.
        <br>
        • For example
        <br>
        • javac -d. Simple.java
        <br>
        • The -d switch specifies the destination where to put the generated class file. You
        
        can use any directory name like /home (in case of Linux), d:/abc (in case of windows) etc. If you want to keep the package within the same directory, you can use. (dot).  
    <br>
</p>
<h4>Appelets:</h4>
<br>
<p>APPLET:
<br>
    • An applet is a special kind of Java program that runs in a Java enabled browser • This is the first Java program that can run over the network using the browser.
    <br>
    Applet is typically embedded inside a web page and runs in the browser.
    <br>
    • In other words, we can say that Applets are small Java applications that can be accessed on an Internet server, transported over Internet, and can be automatically installed and run as apart of a web document.
    <br>
    • After a user receives an applet, the applet can produce a graphical user interface. It has limited access to resources so that it can run complex computations without introducing the risk of viruses (or) breaching data integrity.
<br>
</p>
<h4>Concept of access protection:</h4>
<br>
<p>CONCEPT OF ACCESS PROTECTION:
<br>
    There are two types of modifiers in java : access modifiers and non-access modifiers.
    <br>
    • The access modifiers in java specifies accessibility (scope) of a data member, method, constructor (or) class.
    <br>
    There are 4 Types of Java Access Modifiers :
    <br>
    1. Private.
    <br>
    2. Default.
    <br>
    3. Protected.
<br>
    4. Public.
    <br>
    • There are many non-access modifiers such as static, abstract, synchronized, native, volatile, transient etc., Here, we will learn access modifiers.
<br>
Private Access Modifier :
<br>
0 The private access modifier is accessible only within class.
<br>
• Simple example of private access modifier.
<br>
class A
<br>
{
<br>
private int data=40;
<br>
private void msg()
<br>
System.out.println("Hello Java");
<br>
public class Simple
<br>
public static void main(String args[])
<br>
A obj=new A():
<br>
System.out.println(obj.data)://Compile Time Error obj.msg)://Compile Time Error
<br>
2. Default Access Modifier: If we don't use any modifier, it is treated as default by default. The default modifier is accessible only within package.
<br>
//save by A.java
<br>
package pack;
<br>
class A
<br>
vold msg()
<br>
System.out.println("Hello");
<br>
}
<br>
//save by B.java
<br>
package mypack; import pack.";
<br>
class B
<br>
public static void main(String args[])
<br>
A obj = new A()://Compile Time Error obj.msg()://Compile Time Error
<br>
}
<br> 
Protected Access Modifier:
<br>
The protected access modifier is accessible within package and outside the package but through inheritance only.
<br>
• The protected access modifier can be applied on the data member, method and constructor.

It can't be applied on the class.
<br>
//save by A.java
<br>
package pack;
<br>
public class A
<br>
protected void msg()
<br>
System.out.println("Hello");
<br>
lisave by B.java
<br>
package mypack; Import pack.": class B extends A
<br>
public static void main(String args[])
<br>
B obj = new B();
<br>
obj.msg();
<br>
Public Access Modifier:
<br>
• The public access modifier is accessible everywhere. It has the widest scope among all other modifiers.
<br>
//save by A.java
<br>
package pack;
<br>
public class A
<br>
d
<br>
public void msg()
<br>
System.out.println("Hello");
<br>
}
<br>
//save by B.java
<br>
package mypack;
<br>
import pack.*: class B
<br>
public static void main(String args[])
<br>
A obj = new A();
<br>
obj.msg():
  <br>
</p>
<h4>Features of java:
</h4>
<br>
<p>There is given many features of java. They are also known as java buzz words. The Java Features given below are simple and easy to understand.
    <br>

2. Object-Oriented.
<br>
1. Simple.
<br>
4. Secured.
<br>
6. Architecture neutral.
<br>
3. Platform independent.
<br>
5. Robust
<br>
7. Portable.
<br>
8. Dynamic.
<br>
10. High Performance
<br>
9. Interpreted.
<br>
11. Multi threaded.
<br>
12. Distributed.
<br>
1. Simple:
<br>
(1) Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. (i) It removes complexity because it doesn't use complex and difficult features of

other languages like C and C++, which are as follows. • Concept of Explicit Pointers.
<br>
• Storage classes.
<br>
• Preprocessors and header files.
<br>
Multiple Inheritance.
<br>
Operator Overloading.
<br>
Go to Statements.
<br>
(ii) There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because there is an Automatic Garbage Collection in Java.
<br>
2. Object-oriented:
<br>
⚫ Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object. • Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different

types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior.

Object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a methodology that simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some rules.
<br>
⚫ Basic concepts of OOPs are:
<br>
(i) Object
<br>
(iii) Inheritance <br> (v) Abstraction
<br>
(ii) Class
<br>
(iv) Polymorphism
<br>
3. Platform Independent:
<br>
(vi) Encapsulation
<br>
⚫ Java is platform independent because it is different from other languages like C, C++, etc., which are compiled into platform specific machines while Java is a write once, run anywhere language.
