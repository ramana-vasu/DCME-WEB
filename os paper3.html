    </div>
    <h2>MOSTLY REPEATED QUESTIONS IN PREVIOUS EXAMINATIONS:</h2>
<br>1)what is deadlock.</br>
<br>2)define multiprocessor systems.</br>
<br>3)explain about process synchronization.</br>
<br>4)explain about deadlock.</br>
<br>5)explain about directory structures.</br>
<br>6)write about operating systems.</br>
<h2>ANSWERS FOR REPEATED QUESTIONS</h2>
<br>1)In a multi programming environment a process is said to be in a state of dead lock if it is waiting for an event that 
will never occur. In a system deadlock, one or more processes are deadlocked. A process requests resources, and if the
 resources are not available at that time, the process enters a wait state. It may happen that waiting process will never 
change state, because the resources they have requested are held by other walting processes. This situation is called 
deadlock.</br>
A deadlock occurs in a system if the following four conditions hold simultaneously:

<br>1. Mutual Exclusion: At least one of the resources is non-sharable that is only one process at a time can be use the resource.</br>

2.<br> Hold and Wait: A process exists that is holding on to at least one resource and waiting for an additional resource held by another process.</br>

3.<br> No Preemption : Resources cannot be preempted that is a resource is released only by the process that is holding it.</br>

4.<br> Circular Wait: There exist a set of processes Po, P1..., Pn

of waiting processes such that Po is waiting for a resource held

by P1, P₁ is waiting for a resource held by P2,</br>
<br>2)Multiprocessor systems are also known as parallel systems or tightly coupled systems.</br>

<br>Multiprocessor system is a system with more than one CPU

working in close communication with one another.</br>

<br>tightly couplel system.</br>

<br>Processors share memory and a clock; communication usually takes shared memory.</br>

Advantages:

<br>• Increased through put : More work will be done in less time.</br>

<br>• Economical: Multi processor systems can save more money than multiple single processor systems, because they share peripherals, mass storage, and power supplies.

Increased Reliability: If functions can be distributed properly among several processors, then the failure of one processor will not half the system.</br>
<br>3)Process Synchronization is the task of coordinating the execution of processes in a way that no two processes
 can have access to the same shared data and resources.It is specially needed in a multi-process system when multiple
 processes are running together, and more than one processes try to gain access to the same shared resource or data at the 
same time.This can lead to the inconsistency of shared data. So the change made by one process not necessarily 
reflected when other processes accessed the same shared data. To avoid this type of inconsistency of data, the processes 
need to be synchronized with each other.</br>
<br>4)In a multi programming environment a process is said to be in a state of dead lock if it is waiting for an event that will 
never occur. In a system deadlock, one or more processes are deadlocked. A process requests resources, and if the resources 
are not available at that time, the process enters a wait state. It may happen that waiting process will never change state, 
because the resources they have requested are held by other waiting processes. This situation is called deadlock.</br>
<br>5)Files systems are very large. Files have to be organized. Usually a two level organization is done :
The file system is divided into partitions. Default there is at least one partition. Partitions are nothing but virtual disks with
 each partition considered as a separate storage device.
• Each partition has information about the files in it. This information is nothing but a table of contents. It is known as a
 directory.The directory maintains information about the name, location, size and type of all files in the partition.
 A directory has a logical structure. Directories are files which are under control of the OS. An interactive user can only see some 
of the attributes by using commands Is (UNIX) or dir (MS-DOS).
The following are some common ways of organizing directories i.e., these are the various directory structures.
This is a simple directory structure that is very easy to support. All files reside in one and the same directory.
A single-level directory has limitations as the number of files and users increase. Since there is only one directory to
 list all the files, no two files can have the same name, that is, file names must be unique in order to identity one file 
from another. Even with one user, it is difficult to maintain files with unique names when the number of files becomes larger.
<br>1. Two-Level Directory: The main limitation of single-level directory is to have unique file names by different users. 
One solution to the problem could be to create separate directories A two-level directory structure has one directory exclusively
 for each user. The directory structure of each user is similar in structure and maintains file information about files present in 
that directory only. The operating system has one master directory for a partition. This directory has entries for each of the user
 directories.for each user.Files with same names exist across user directories but not in the same user directory.
 File maintenance is easy. Users are isolated from one another. But when users work in a group and each wants to access
 files in another users directory, it may not be possible.</br>
Access to a file is through user name and file name. This is known as a path. Thus a path uniquely defines a file.
<br>For example: In MS-DOS if 'C' is the partition the C"/user1/ Test, C:\User2\test, C:\user3-C are all files in user directories. 
Files could be created, deleted, searched and renamed in the user directories only.</br>
<br>2. Three Structure Directories: A two level directory is a tree of height two with the master file directory at the root having user
 directories as descendants that in turn have the files themselves as descendants. Tree-structured directories area generalization 
of this two-level directory structure to have a directory structure of arbitrary height. This generalization allows users to organize 
files within user directories into sub directories. Every files has a unique path. Here the path is from the root through all the 
sub directories to the specific file.Usually the user has a current directory. User created sub directories could be traversed. 
Files are usually accessed by giving their path names. Path names could be either absolute or relative. Absolute path names 
begin with the root and give the complete path down to the file. Relative path names beginwith the current directory. 
Allowing users to define sub.directories allows for organizing user files based on topics. A directory is treated as yet another file in 
the directory, higher up in the hierarchy. To delete a directory it must be empty. Two options exist: delete all files and then delete 
the directory or delete all entries in the directory when the directory is deleted. Deletion may be a recursive process since directory 
to be deleted may contain sub directories.</br>
<br>6)Operating system can be defined as "system software which acts as interface between user and the system and manages 
the resources in efficient way"</br>
The primary goal of an operating system is:To make the computer system easy to use.
<br>• Secondary goal is hardware resource management.</br>
The operating system is the most basic program in a computer. All computers have an operating system that us used for starting
 the computer and running other programs (application programs). The operating system performs important tasks like receiving 
input from the keyboard and mouse, sending information to the screen, keeping track files and directories on the disk, as well as 
controlling the various units such as disk printers etc.
