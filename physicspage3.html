    <h2>INTRODUCTION TO PHYSICS</h2> 
     <br>
     
<br>
        Physics is the branch of science that deals with the structure of matter and how the fundamental constituents of the universe interact. It studies objects ranging from the very small using quantum mechanics to the entire universe using general relativity

 <h3>ANSWERS FOR REPEATED QUESTIONS:</h3> 
 <b>define:</b>
   <b>a)work</b>
<p>
For work to be done, a force must be exerted and there must be motion or displacement in the direction of the force. The work done by a force acting on an object is equal to the magnitude of the force multiplied by the distance moved in the direction of the force. Work has only magnitude and no direction. Hence, work is a scalar quantity.</p>
<h5>Formula of Work</h5>
<p>The work done by a force is defined to be the product of the component of the force in the direction of the displacement and the magnitude of this displacement. </p>
   <b>b)power</b>
<p>Power is a physical concept with several different meanings, depending on the context and the available information. We can define power as the rate of doing work, and it is the amount of energy consumed per unit of time</p>
<h5>Formula of Power</h5>
<p> As discussed, power is the rate of doing work. Therefore, it can be calculated by dividing work done by time. The formula for power is given below.</p>
<center><i>p=w/t</i></center>
<center><p>Where, P is the power, W is the work done and t is the time taken</p></center>
<b>c)Energy</b>
<p>Energy is the ability to perform work. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, and it can only be transformed from one form to another. The unit of Energy is the same as of Work, i.e. Joules. Energy is found in many things, and thus there are different types of energy.<br>
All forms of energy are either kinetic or potential. The energy in motion is known as Kinetic Energy, whereas Potential Energy is the energy stored in an object and is measured by the amount of work done   </p>

<h4><p>4.State coulomb's invers square law of magnetism</p></h4>
<p>
It states that the force of attraction or repulsion F between two magnetic poles of strength m, and m, separated by a distance r is directly proportional to the product of pole strengths and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between there centres</p>
<p>The law states that the magnitude, or absolute value, of the attractive or repulsive electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of their charges and inversely proportional to the squared distance between them</p><br>
<h4><p>5.State and prove law of  conservation of energy in the case of a freely falling body </p></h4>
<p>When a body falls freely, only the gravitational force influences its motion. During the fall the body possesses two types of energies, potential energy and kinetic energy. The sum of these energies is called mechanical energy.</p>
Law of conservation of energy states that:−

Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed, but it can transform from one form to another form.<br>
<b>Derivation :</b> <br>
<p>m = m = mass of the body</p>
<p>g = Acceleration due to gravity</p>
<p>Suppose a body is at point A initially. Then it falls freely, during the motion mechanical energy of the body is conserved.</p>
<p>At a point A:</p>
<p>AC = height of object from ground= h</p>
<p>Initial speed u = 0</p>
<p>So, Potential energy at A, P.E. = mgh</p>	
<p>Kinetic energy at A, K.E.=1/2
mv<sup>2</sup>=0</p>

<p>Therefore total energy at A is 
TE = P.E + K.E = mgh + 0</p>

<p>T.E.=mgh</p>

<p>At point B,</p>

<p>Potential energy</p>, 
<p>PE = mg (BC) = mg (h – x) = mgh – mgx</p>
<p>Use kinematics equation</p>
<p>v<sup>2</up>=u<sup>2</sup>+2gx</p>
<p>v<sup>2</sup>=0+2gx</p>
<p>K.E.=1/2mv<sup>2</sup>=1/2m(2gx)</p>
<p>K.E.=mgx</p>
<p>Therefore total energy at B is,T.E.<sub>B<sub>=K.E+P.E.=mgx+mg(h−x)=mgh$</p>
<p>At point C,</p>

<p>Potential energy, </p>
<p>P.E. = 0</p>
 <p>P.E. = 0</p>
<p>Kinetic energy, K.E.=1/2mv<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p>Use kinematics equation:</p>
<p>v<sup>2</sup>=u<sup>2</sup>+2gh</p>
</p>v<sup>2</sup>=0+2gh=2gh
<p>So, K.E=1/2mg(2gh)=mgh</p>
<p>Therefore total energy at B is, T.E.<sub>C<sub>=K.E.+P.E.=mgh+0=mgh</p>
<p>From equations (i), (ii) and (iii) we have,</p>
<p>
Therefore, T.E.<sub>A</sub>=T.E.<sub>B</sub>=T.E.<sub>C</sub>
<p>Hence, the total energy of the body is conserved during free fall.</p><br>
<h4>6.Advantages of friction:</h4>
<p>1. Friction enables us to walk freely.</p>
<p>2. It helps to support ladder against wall</p>
<p>3. It becomes possible to transfer one form of energy to another.</p>
<p>4. Objects can be piled up without slipping.</p>
<p>5. Breaks of vehicles work due to friction.</p>
<p>6. It is becomes difficult to walk on a slippery road due to low friction. When we move on ice, it becomes difficult to walk due to low friction of ice.</p>
<p>7. We can not fix nail in the wood or wall if there is no friction. It is friction which holds the nail.</p>
<p>8. A horse can not pull a cart unless friction furnishes him a secure Foothold.</p>
<p>9. We can write on a paper or on a board.</p>
<p>10. Friction helps in applying the brakes.</p>
<p>11. It helps in walking on floor.</p>
<p>12. Coffee mug stays on the dashboard</p>
<p>13. Shuffling across a carpet to shock someone</p>
<p>14. Draging of atmosphire with earth is possible</p>
<p>15. Helps to pevents the life on earth by burning astroids</p><br>
<h4>7.State the kirchiff's law of electricity</h4>
<p>The law states that the amount of current flowing into a node is equal to the sum of currents flowing out of it. In other words, the algebraic sum of all the currents in any given circuit will be equal to zero.</p>
<p>
The law states that at any circuit junction, the sum of the currents flowing into and out of that junction are equal. In simple terms, what KCL really says is that, The sum of all currents entering a node is equal to the sum of all currents leaving the node.</p><br>
<h4>8.Write the dimensional gormulae of the following</h4>
<p>a)velocity: </p>
<p>Velocity defines the direction of the movement of the body or the object. Speed is primarily a scalar quantity. Velocity is essentially a vector quantity. It is the rate of change of distance.</p>
<p>b)Energy:</p>  
<p>energy, in physics, the capacity for doing work. It may exist in potential, kinetic, thermal, electrical, chemical, nuclear, or other various forms. There are, moreover, heat and work—i.e., energy in the process of transfer from one body to another.</p>
<p>c)Time period:</p>
<p>The time taken for one complete oscillation to occur is called the Time Period. It is denoted by T. Its unit is seconds. Frequency is the number of vibrations or the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time. The frequency is measured in terms of Hertz.</p>
