    <h2>INTRODUCTION TO S.E:</h2> 
     <br>
     <p>Introduction to Software Engineering:
<br>
        Software is a program or set of programs containing instructions that provide desired functionality. And Engineering is the process of designing and building something that serves a particular purpose and finds a cost-effective solution to problems.
        <br>
        Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It is a systematic and disciplined approach to software development that aims to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software. Software engineering includes a variety of techniques, tools, and methodologies, including requirements analysis, design, testing, and maintenance. <br></p>

 <h2>ANSWERS FOR REPEATED QUESTIONS:</h2>  <br>
 <h4>BAD SRS Document:</h4>
   <br>
   <p>1.over specification:
     <br>
      over specification course when you try to address how to address aspects in SRS document
       <br>
       Eg:library automation problems
         <br>
         forward referring seriously reduce the readability of the specification.
           <br>
           2.wishful thinking:
             <br>
             This types of problem consults description of aspects which would be difficult to implement
               <br>
   </p>
   <h4>Cohesion:</h4>
   <p>A measure of relative functional strength of a module.

    It is natural extension of information hiding. A cohesive module performs a single task with in a software procedure with little interaction with other procedure. Highly cohesive modules are highly independence low cohesion should be a avoided on
    
    modular design.
<br>
    <h4>Coupling:</h4>
<br>
        <p>Coupling: A measure of relative interdependence among modules. Coupling is a measure of interconnection in among modules in a software structure. There are various types of coupling which is based on the following:
            <br>
            • Interface complexity.
<br>
• Point of reference.
<br>
Data pass across.
<br>
