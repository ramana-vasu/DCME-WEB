<h2>ANSWER FOR REPEATED QUETSIONS</H2>
<h4>1)what is the process of navigation through pages</h4>
<p>To navigate between pages in HTML, use the <a> (anchor) tag with an href attribute pointing to the destination page's URL. When users click the link, their browser takes them to the specified page.</p>
<p> Certainly! You can enhance navigation by styling links with CSS to make them visually appealing, and you can also use target="_blank" to open links in a new tab or window for a better user experience.</p>
<h4>2)Define html and css.</h4>
<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):-is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It consists of a set of elements and tags that define various components on a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more. HTML provides the structure and semantics of a webpage, allowing browsers to render and display the content.</p>

<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):- is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation and styling of HTML documents. CSS defines how elements on a web page should be displayed, including aspects like layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness. It separates the content (defined in HTML) from its visual presentation, enabling web developers to control the look and feel of a website efficiently and consistently across multiple pages.</p>
<h4> 3)state the steps in building a website</h4>
<p>Building a website involves several steps, from planning to deployment. Here's a high-level overview of the process:-</p>

<br>1. Planning:<br>
   <p>- Define the purpose and goals of your website.</p>
   <p>- Identify your target audience.</p>
   <p>- Plan the site's content and structure.</p>

   <p> - Make data-driven decisions to improve your website's performance and user experience.</p>

<p>Building a website is an ongoing process that involves continuous improvement and maintenance to meet your goals and the needs of your audience.</p>
<h4>4)How to delete cookie? </h4>
<p>In HTML, you don't directly delete cookies since cookies are managed using JavaScript or server-side scripting languages like PHP. However, you can set a cookie with an expiration date in the past to effectively delete it. Here's how you can do it using JavaScript:</p>

<p>html</p>
<p><script></p>
    <p>// Set the cookie's expiration date to a past date </p>
    <p>function deleteCookie(cookieName) {</p>
        <p>document.cookie = cookieName + "=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";</p>
    <p>}</p>

    <p>// Call the function to delete a specific cookie.</p>
    <p>deleteCookie("your_cookie_name");</p>
<p></script></p>


<p>Replace "your_cookie_name" with the name of the cookie you want to delete. This JavaScript code sets the cookie's expiration date to a date in the past, which effectively removes the cookie from the user's browser.</p>

<h4>5)explain list tag in HTML with example </h4>
<p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and styling of HTML or XML documents. It allows web developers to control the visual aspects of web pages, including layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and more. CSS is essential for making web content attractive and user-friendly. There are three primary types of CSS:</p>

<br>1.Inline CSS :-<br>
   <p>- Inline CSS is applied directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute.</p>
   <p>- It's useful for making quick, element-specific style changes.</p>
   <p>- Example:-
     html</p>
     <p> style="color: blue; font-size: 18px;">This is an example of inline CSS.</p>
     

<br>2.Internal CSS:-<br>
   <p>- Internal CSS is defined within the  element in the  section of an HTML document.</p>
   <p>- It applies styles to multiple elements within the same HTML document.</p>
   <p>- Example:-
    html</p>
        
            <p>{
                 color: black;
                 font-size: 20px;}</p>
         <p>This is an example of internal CSS.</p>
     </body>
     </html>
     

<br>3. External CSS:<br>
   <p>- External CSS is stored in a separate .css file and linked to an HTML document using the <link> element.</p>
   <p>- It's ideal for maintaining consistent styles across multiple web pages.</p>
   <p>Example:
     HTML:</p>
         <p>(link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css")</p>
         <p>This is an example of external CSS.</p>
     
    <p> CSS (styles.css):
      
         color: green;
         font-size: 24px;</p>
     
     

<p>Each type of CSS has its use case, with external CSS being the most common for larger projects due to its maintainability and ease of making consistent style changes across multiple pages. </p>
<h4>6)what is css? Explain  different types of with example </h4>
<p>In HTML, you can create lists using several different list tags. The two main types of lists are ordered lists and unordered lists. Here's an explanation of list tags with examples:</p>

<p>1.Unordered Lists (\<ul\):-</p>
   <p>- Unordered lists are used to create lists of items without any specific order or sequence.</p>
   <p>- Each list item is marked with a bullet point or some other marker.</p>
   <p>- Example:
     html</p>
     <ul>
         <li>Item 1</li>
         <li>Item 2</li>
         <li>Item 3</li>
     </ul>
     
     <p>This will create an unordered list with three items:-</p>
     <p>- Item 1</p>
     <p>- Item 2</p>
     <p>- Item 3</p>

<p>2.Ordered Lists (\<ol\>):-
   - Ordered lists are used to create lists of items in a specific sequence, typically numbered or lettered.</p>
   - Each list item is automatically numbered.</p>
   - Example:
     html </p>
     <ol>
         <li>First item</li></p>
         <li>Second item</li></p>
         <li>Third item</li></p>
     </ol>
     
     This will create an ordered list with three items:-</p>
     1. First item</p>
     2. Second item</p>
     3. Third item </p>

 3. Definition Lists (\<dl\>):-</p>
   - Definition lists are used to create lists of terms and their corresponding definitions.</p>
   - They consist of terms (\<dt\>) and their definitions (\<dd\>).</p>
   - Example:
     html
     <dl>
         <dt>HTML</dt>
         <dd>Hypertext Markup Language</dd>
         <dt>CSS</dt>
         <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd>
     </dl>
     
     <p>This will create a definition list with two term-definition pairs:-</p>
<h4> </h4>
<p> </p>
     <p>- HTML: Hypertext Markup Language.</p>
    <p> - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets.</p>

<p>These list tags help organize and structure content on web pages, making it easier for readers to understand the information presented. You can also apply CSS styles to lists to customize their appearance. </p>
<h4>7) write about parameter passing mechanism java script with example.  </h4>
<p>In JavaScript, parameter passing mechanisms determine how values are passed to functions when you call them. JavaScript uses a mechanism called "pass-by-value" for primitive data types and "pass-by-reference" for objects. Here's an explanation with examples:-</p>

<p>1.Pass-by-Value (Primitive Data Types):-</p>
   <p>- When you pass a primitive data type (like numbers, strings, or booleans) as a function argument, a copy of the value is passed to the function.</p>
   <p>- Changes made to the parameter within the function do not affect the original value.</>
   <p>- Example:
     javascript</p>
    <p> function modifyValue(x) {
         x = 42; // This modifies the copy of the value, not the original
     }</p>

    <p> let num = 10;
    <p> modifyValue(num);</p>
    <p> console.log(num); // Output: 10 (original value is not changed).</p>
     

<br>2.Pass-by-Reference (Objects):-<br>
   - When you pass an object (including arrays and functions) as a function argument, a reference to the object is passed.</p>
   - Changes made to the object's properties or contents within the function affect the original object because they both refer to the same memory location.</p>
   - Example:
     javascript.</p>
     function modifyObject(obj) {
         obj.property = "new value"; // This modifies the original object
     }</p>

     let myObject = { property: "old value" };</p>
     modifyObject(myObject);</p>
     console.log(myObject.property); // Output: "new value" (original object is modified)</p>
     

<br>3. Pass-by-Value for Objects (Copy of Reference):-<br>
   - It's important to note that when you pass an object as a parameter, you are technically passing a copy of the reference to the object.</p>
   - While the reference itself is passed by value, both the original and the copied reference still point to the same object in memory.</p>
   - Example:
     javascript</p>
     function modifyReference(ref) {
         ref = null; // This changes the copied reference, not the original object
     }</p>

     let myObject = { property: "value" };</p>
     modifyReference(myObject);</p>
     console.log(myObject); // Output: { property: "value" } (original object is not affected).</p>
     

<p>Understanding these parameter passing mechanisms in JavaScript is essential for working with functions and objects effectively. It's crucial to be aware of whether you're modifying a copy of a value or a reference to an object when working with function parameters. </p>

<h4>8) Explain different types of arrays with examples.</h4>
<p>In HTML, you typically use JavaScript to work with arrays. JavaScript provides several types of arrays, including single-dimensional arrays, multi-dimensional arrays, and arrays with specific methods. Here's an explanation of each type with examples:-</p>

<p>1.Single-Dimensional Array:-</p>
   <p>- A single-dimensional array is a list of values stored in a linear structure.</p>
  <p> - Example:
     javascript
     let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];</p>
     

<p>2.Multi-Dimensional Array:-</p>
   <p>- A multi-dimensional array is an array of arrays, creating a grid or matrix-like structure.</p>
   </p>- Example:
     javascript</p>
     <p>let matrix = [</p>
        <p> [1, 2, 3],</p>
         <p>[4, 5, 6],</p>
         <p>[7, 8, 9],</p>
     ]; </p>
     

<p>3.Typed Array:-</p>
   <p>- Typed arrays are specialized arrays with a fixed data type for all elements.</p>
   <p>- They are often used for handling binary data, like in WebGL or file operations. </p>
   <p>- Example:
     javascript</p>
     <p>let intArray = new Int32Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);</p>
     

<p>4.Array-Like Objects:-</p>
   <p>- Array-like objects are not true arrays but behave similarly.</p>
   <p>- They have numeric indices and a length property but may lack array methods like push and pop.</p>
   <p>- Example:
     javascript.</p>
     <p>let arrayLike = { 0: "a", 1: "b", 2: "c", length: 3 };</p>
     

<p>5.Array with Methods:-</p>
   <p>- JavaScript arrays come with built-in methods for manipulation, such as push, pop, splice, and forEach.</p>
   <p>- Example:
     javascript.</p>
    <p> let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];</p>
     numbers.push(6); // Add an element to the end</p>
     numbers.pop();   // Remove the last element</p>
     

<p>6.Empty Array:</p>
   <p>- You can create an empty array and later add elements to it.</p>
   <p>- Example:
     javascript.</p>
     let emptyArray = [];</p>
     emptyArray.push("element1");</p>
     emptyArray.push("element2");</p>
     

<p>7.Array with Constructor:</p>
   <p>- You can create an array with the Array constructor, although this method is less common than using literal notation.</p>
   <p>- Example:
     javascript
     let colors = new Array("red", "green", "blue");</p>
     

<p>Remember that arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, meaning the first element has an index of 0, the second has an index of 1, and so on. You can access, modify, and perform various operations on arrays using JavaScript's array methods. </p>
